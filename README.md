# The Choice and Impact of Metric in Persistence Homology.

**MATH471 Topology** -- Professor Lori Ziegelmeier, Spring 2023. 

Final project for Topology related to the choice and impact of metric on persistent homology. Persistent Homology has an implicit assumption
of a metric, but how is the analysis of high-dimension data within persistent homology impacted by the choice of metric?
